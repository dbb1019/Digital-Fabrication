        Additive Manufacturing is an industrial term that refers to all manufacturing technologies that construct three-dimensional objects by adding material layer by layer. It encompasses various material printing processes, including metal printing, ceramic printing, and resin printing, and is commonly used in industrial production, such as aerospace and medical fields. 3D printing is the same as Additive Manufacturing (just an alternative name), but it is more commonly used to describe rapid prototyping technologies based on plastic or resin materials. Its basic process involves CAD modeling, followed by conversion into machine control instructions for layer-by-layer slicing. It can print with different materials, with PLA being the most common, but it can also use ceramics and other materials. This technology can also be applied beyond industrial fields, such as in architecture, art design, and more.

        FDM or FFF is one of the most common 3D printing technologies. It uses a heated nozzle to melt thermoplastic materials (such as PLA and ABS) and extrudes them layer by layer to form a three-dimensional object. This method is low-cost and easy to operate, making it widely used in prototyping and other fields. However, its resolution is relatively low, with visible layering, and the support structures can be complex and sometimes difficult to remove. SLA uses photosensitive resin and ultraviolet light to achieve higher printing precision, but the material cost is higher. SLS and SLM are suitable for printing with metal or nylon powder, allowing the production of stronger industrial parts.

       greater than the main content container.  Without this, when an a:hover is triggered in the main container,
       IE reflows the page and cuts off the menu at the bottom of the main container. -->
