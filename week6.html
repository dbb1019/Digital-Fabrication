        Additive Manufacturing is an industrial term that refers to all manufacturing technologies that construct 3d objects by adding material layer by layer. It contains multiple material printing processes, such as metal, ceramic, resin and so on. AM is commonly used in industrial production and fabrication. 3D printing is the same as Additive Manufacturing (it is just an alternative name), but it is more commonly used to describe rapid prototyping technologies based on plastic or resin materials. Its basic process involves CAD modeling, followed by conversion into machine control instructions for layer-by-layer slicing. It can print with different materials, with PLA being the most common, and it can also use ceramics and other materials. This technology can also be applied to many fields, such as in architecture, prototyping, art and design, and more.

        FDM or FFF is one of the most common 3D printing technologies. It uses a heated nozzle to melt thermoplastic materials (such as PLA and ABS) and extrudes them layer by layer to form a three-dimensional object. But its resolution is relatively low, with visible layering (but it can be adjusted through setting), and the support structures can be complex and sometimes difficult to remove. But it is low-cost and easy to operate. And there are also different types of PLA, such as PLA with metal, PLA with fiber, and also soft or flexible PLA, and conductive PLA. SLA uses photosensitive resin and ultraviolet light to achieve higher printing precision, but the material cost is higher. SLS and SLM are suitable for printing with metal or nylon powder. the objects they print are stronger and can be used as industrial parts.

        This week, I continued working in FreeCAD to create an egg holder, but unlike my previous designs for laser cut, this one is fully enclosed with a half hollow sphere. I mainly explored the Part Workbench, which I found quite convenient for modeling regular 3D shapes. Previously, I had been using Part Design workbench and drawing sketches, but the Part Workbench made certain tasks much easier and I can easily create spheres, cylinders, cubes, and many other shapes. I defined four parameters: thickness, egg diameter, leg width, and leg height. To create a hollow structure that can hold an egg, I used the Cut operation. Then for the leg, I combined a cylinder and a half sphere and used the Cut function to cut a shape on the cylinder. Additionally, I used the Transform function to move and assemble different parts in space.
        And here are the screenshots of how I created this model by using FreeCAD.

        Regarding the settings for 3D printing, first, open the 3D printing software and select the original prusa MK4 and mini MK4 printer. I first rotated the model 180 degrees along the x axis to turn it upside down, because the diameter of this surface is the largest and I don't want to have too many support structures on the outside of the model. Then select Generic PLA in Filament. Then I selected support everywhere, because there are two small holes in the middle of the leg of my model that need support, and the connection between the upper and lower parts also need support. But the printing time exceeded two hours. I set the infill to 10%, which determines the density of the filling structure in the 3D printed wall. I wanted to make the filling density smaller, but it still failed. But I didn't want to sacrifice the accuracy of the print, so I used standard accuracy and maintained the layer height at 0.2mm, because I didn't want the surface of the model to be too rough. So I had to change the scale to 76% (even though it won't hold eggs), and finally controlled it within two hours. I also used the two icon buttons in the lower left corner of the software to preview the 3D printing process. After that, save the file, save it to a USB drive and insert it into the 3D printer, select the corresponding file on the small screen and you can start printing.
