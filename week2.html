        Different types of media files play different roles on the web today. Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.) are commonly used for visuals such as product photos on some e-commercial sites, icons for navigation menus, and backgrounds. Videos (MP4, etc.) offer dynamic storytelling and tutorials. Source code files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) form the backbone of webpages, and enable structure, styling, and interactivity. Project files like PDFs and ZIP archives allow users to download bundled resources or documents such as website templates, academic papers, etc.

        There are different types of media files on the web nowadays, such as images, videos, and project files. Images are commonly used to display products on online shopping sites, as well as some UI stuff like icons or mouse cursors. There are different types of image formats, for example, JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc. Videos are used for online entertainment like TV series as well as some tutorials. Common video formats include MP4 mov and so on. Project files like pdf and zip or source code allow users to download documents such as website templates, academic papers, etc.

        Images used on the web should be optimized to ensure fast load times without sacrificing quality. Cropping removes unnecessary parts of an image, focusing attention on key elements. Resizing ensures the image fits its intended display size and avoids scaling issues. Compression reduces file size, with lossy compression (e.g., JPEG) and offers smaller files at the cost of some quality and lossless compression (e.g., PNG) preserving original quality but with larger file sizes. Tools like Photoshop can help with compression. I used Preview on Mac and online converter to compress this image. Also, WebP is a good modern format for compressed images with smaller sizes than JPEG/PNG.

        Images used on the web need to load quickly, so they should often be optimized. We can reduce the space occupied by images by cropping and removing unnecessary parts of the image. But more often, images need to be compressed and resized to fit their intended display size. Compression reduces file size, lossy compression (such as JPEG) sacrifices some quality; and lossless compression (such as PNG) retains original quality but has a larger file size. Photoshop and some other free local or online tools can be used to compress images. I used Preview on a Mac to compress this image by clicking adjust size under the Tools tab to set the length, width, and resolution of the image. In addition, WebP is a compressed image format that can make the image smaller than JPEG/PNG.

        Optimizing videos for the web involves capturing in a suitable resolution, cutting unnecessary sections, resizing to meet display requirements, and compressing to reduce file size. HD resolution (1280x720px) strikes a good balance between quality and size. Tools like Adobe Premiere Pro or some online converters allow resizing and compression. The MP4 format (H.264 codec) is widely supported for web use. I use free convertor online by Adobe to compress this video.

        Ways to optimize videos for the web include choosing the right resolution, trimming the length of the video, adding subtitles to the video, and more. We usually use HD resolution (1280x720px or 1920x1080px). Tools such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut, and Apple's Compressor or some online converters allow resizing, compression, and format conversion. The MP4 format (H.264 codec) is currently the most widely used format on the web. I used Adobe's free online converter to compress this video.

        Hosting videos on platforms like YouTube or Vimeo offers additional benefits, including automated compression, global accessibility, and built-in playback controls. These platforms also handle video compatibility across devices, reducing the need for developers to encode videos for different browsers. However, embedding external videos can come with drawbacks like ads or branding that may disrupt user experience. Self-hosting small, optimized videos is a better option for cleaner integration.

        In actual use of videos, I usually host them on platforms such as YouTube or Vimeo. These platforms can automatically compress and handle video compatibility across devices. However, embedding external videos may bring disadvantages such as advertising or branding, which may ruin the user experience when watching the video.

        I wrote <code>meta name="robots" content="noai"</code>, 
        <code>meta name="ai-permissions" content="noindex"</code> in this HTML file. 
        These tell AI not to use or index my page in their training datasets. 
        I chose to restrict the use of my documentation page for AI training purposes because I want to maintain control over my work. 
        AI systems often aggregate data without understanding its context, which could dilute the intent behind my content.
        I also added AI data statement in footnote and added an ai.txt file.
