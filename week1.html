    <p>Last week, I learned about building websites with GitHub Pages. This experience has introduced me to the basics of using Git for version control, which has proven invaluable in tracking changes and collaborating on different tasks. By pushing commits regularly and managing branches, I have developed an understanding of how to keep my project organized and efficient. Moreover, I learned HTML and CSS, which has allowed me to structure my website‚Äôs content and design its visual elements. And it helped me bring my ideas to life.
    </p>
    <p>Throughout this process, I have also become more aware of how important proper documentation is for any success of the projects. Writing clear commit messages and maintaining a well-structured repository ensures that future modifications are easier to implement. 
    </p>
    <p>I want to explore more styling techniques and incorporate frameworks that can make my website look more professional and visually appealing. </p>
    <p>In the coming weeks, I want to experiment with JavaScript, I hope to add interactive features that enhance user engagement. Additionally, I plan to explore GitHub Actions for automation, streamlining workflows, and improving project efficiency.</p>
