        MCU (Microcontroller) is a single-chip computer that integrates one or more processor cores (CPU), memory (RAM, ROM/Flash), and programmable input/output (I/O) interfaces.
        MCUs can be applied in many fields, such as embedded systems, including household appliances; robotics, for controlling motor movements; and sensor-based systems, such as smart home applications, wearable systems and applications in the field of ubiquitous computing. They are also used in the game to create tangible interfaces. 
        We often use Arduino and ESP32 for prototyping or creating interactive art installations.
        Additionally, MCUs play a crucial role in industrial automation, where they are used for process control, real-time monitoring, and communication between machines in manufacturing systems.

      <p>
        Rephrase: First sentence: MCU (Micro Controller Unit) is a small computer on a single integrated circuit (IC) that controls device operations and specific systems. It integrated with CPU, memory and programmable I/O interfaces.
        Last sentence: Also, MCUs can be used in industrial automation, such as control, monitoring and communication. 
      </p>
      <p>
        * I only use generative AI for the definition of MCU and also the last sentence. Other parts were written by myself. The examples I gave are some application that I have experienced or worked with like smart home, robots, also ubicomp, and tangible interfeces for games.

        Voltage, current, and resistance are fundamental concepts in electronics, and they are related through Ohm's Law: V = I × R. 
        In this equation, V represents voltage (measured in volts, V), I represents current (measured in amperes, A), and R represents resistance (measured in ohms, Ω).
        Voltage (V) is the potential difference that drives the flow of electric current, similar to water pressure in a pipe. 
        Current (I) is the rate at which electric charge flows, comparable to the flow rate of water.
        Resistance (R) limits the flow of current, much like a narrow section of a pipe that restricts water flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rephrase: Voltage, current, and resistance are related through Ohm's Law: V = I × R. 
        The concept of voltage is related to electric potential, which is a potential energy storage. But voltage is the difference in electric potential. This potential energy can drive the movement of charges. V represents voltage (measured in volts, V). 
        Current can be understood as the rate at which charge flows over time. More specifically, current indicates how much "charge" (usually electrons or ions) passes through a certain cross-section of a conductor per unit time. It is measured in Ampere, A. 
        A resistor is a component in an electrical circuit that dissipates electrical potential energy (electrical energy) by converting it into heat (or other forms of energy), limiting the flow of current in the circuit in the process. It is measured in Ohm, Ω. 
      </p>
      <p>
        * To be honest, the content of the paragraph I submitted the first time is the version I rephrased. But since you asked me to rewrite it, I also think that the previous definition is a bit imprecise, so I decided to define voltage, current and resistance from a different angle.
        Also, the course requirements for this course only state that personal experience cannot be used in generative AI. There are some definitions that are actually only a few ways of saying it: one plus one equals two. I have already spent a lot of time writing some junior high school physics, and I don’t know how to do my homework in the future so that I don’t have to rewrite it.

        Place the pin headers on a breadboard, then position the XIAO board onto the headers. Use a flux pen to clean the surface before soldering. When soldering, use an appropriate temperature (typically 320-370°C) to avoid overheating and damaging components. Since solder releases fumes, turn on the fume extractor before starting the soldering process. Before soldering, dampen the sponge with water. Start by soldering the first and last pin, then proceed with the middle pins. After finishing, turn off all equipment. Inspect the solder joints carefully to ensure they are smooth and shiny, without cold joints or bridges between pins. Finally, we can use a multimeter to check whether the solder joints are functioning correctly.

        The #define is used to define constants or macros, such as #define LED_PIN 13, which typically refers to the LED on Arduino's pin 13. The setup() function is the first part executed when the Arduino runs and is executed only once. It is usually used to set pin modes or initialize the port of serial communication. The loop() function is the main loop where Arduino continuously executes the code inside loop(), making it suitable for monitoring sensors, controlling motors, and more. The pinMode() function is used to specify whether a pin is set as an input (INPUT) or output (OUTPUT). The digitalWrite() function is used when a pin is set as OUTPUT, allowing it to output either a high voltage (HIGH) or a low voltage (LOW). Arduino supports various variable types, such as int, float, char, and bool. The if...else... statement is a conditional structure used to set specific conditions, such as turning on an LED when a button is pressed.

        An Arduino library is a set of pre-written code that can be used to control specific hardware (such as sensors, displays, communication modules, etc.) or perform specific computing tasks (such as filtering, mathematical calculations, data storage, etc.). Arduino comes with some standard libraries, and you can also install third-party libraries to expand its functionality.
        We can install libraries using the Library Manager or by manually downloading a ZIP file.
        For example, the Adafruit_NeoPixel library can easily control NeoPixel LEDs without having to manually write complex PWM control code.

    <p>First, I included the <code>#include &lt;Adafruit_NeoPixel.h&gt;</code> library to use the NeoPixel functionalities.</p>
    <p>Then, I initialized the NeoPixel in the <code>setup()</code> function:</p>
    <p>
        <code>Adafruit_NeoPixel pixels(NUMPIXELS, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);</code><br>
        <code>pixels.begin();</code>
    </p>
    <p>Next, I defined a set of RGB colors:</p>
    <p>
        <code>
        uint32_t colors[] = { <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;pixels.Color(15, 25, 205), // Blue <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;pixels.Color(103, 25, 205), // Purple <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;pixels.Color(233, 242, 205), // White <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;pixels.Color(233, 23, 23), // Red <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;pixels.Color(12, 66, 101) // Cyan <br>
        };
        </code>
    </p>
    <p>I used <code>setPixelColor()</code> to select a color and <code>show()</code> to update the LED:</p>
    <p>
        <code>pixels.setPixelColor(0, pixels.Color(255, 0, 0));</code><br>
        <code>pixels.show();</code>
    </p>
    <p>Finally, I used <code>digitalRead(Button)</code> to read the button state and a counter to cycle through the predefined colors.</p>
