    <p>💅🎀 Hello! I'm Xuedan (Annie) Gao, a master’s student in new media. I'm interested in building connctions between human and nonhuman. I have a background in music technology and film. In my spare time, I love listening to music, creating music, singing, making ceramics, building Legos, crafting quirky things, weaving, reading and traveling.
    </p>
    <p>🐱 I have a cat called <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R1lB_JWKxOgvvnvBh7T4yugq-Jye5oHJ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Tuantuan</a>. And I’ve always dreamed of having a guinea pig.</p>
    <p>🤓 Most of my work can be found in my website. And this is my actual personal website (yes, it's real this time!): <a href="https://xuedan-gao.com/" target="_blank">https://xuedan-gao.com/</a></p>
    <p>⚠️ Note: Aalto's WiFi system bans my personal website, and I don't know why. But if you want to check it out, just switch to a different network.</p>
